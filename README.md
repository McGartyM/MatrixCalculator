# MatrixCalculator

Java based matrix calculator implementing undergraduate Linear Algebra concepts with JavaFX GUI. This calculator was not designed to be the fastest implementation of these algorithms.

----
## Versions 0.2.0
After a few months of development I am proud to release my first stable version
of my Matrix calculator.

If you wish to recompile and build the application, you will need to ensure you have
JavaFX included as module with javac. My development has been entirely in Linux and my
build script only supports it.

With upcoming versions, I plan on expanding the cross platform implementation as well as the
building and packaging process.


----
## Upcoming Features
1. Proper resizing across all GUI components.
2. GUI styling for a more pleasant looking application.
3. More error checking functionality within the GUI.
  - Whenever an operations is undefined or fails, it only prints to the console.
4. Packaging the application into an executable.
5. Publicizing, refining, and expanding on my testing suite.
6. More Matrix operations.
